# Writely, a Wordpress Theme

In the not-so-distant past I was surfin’ the web and found a number of sites that had really beautiful, simple typography. The type of type that makes you want to read more. You know. I thought to myself, “Self, you should make your blog look like this.” So I set out to find a nice, simple theme that was designed for reading. Easy, right? Not really.

I searched for a bit and came up empty handed so I made one. Here it is. It’s very simple. Here’s what it has:

- Main menu
- Footer menu
- Footer “sidebar” that displays each “widget” as a column (1/3 width).

Other things to note:

- Narrow reading area
- Responsive (so it looks good on smaller screens)
- No cruft

Try it out. Use it if you like.
